## Use of AI tooling

You usually use AI tools? Great! Please use them. At SMG we do as well!

## Setup

With either yarn or npm installed, run:

```bash
yarn install | npm install
yarn start | npm start
```

## Instructions

This is a Typescript project.

Please complete the following challenges in order:

1. Utilise the Listing component (`src/components/Listing`) and display all the listings (`/src/assets/listings.json`) on the Home Page.

1. Allow the user to click on a listing and navigate to the specific listing details page and add a back button to return to the home page.

1. Set up a simple server with an API to serve the listings. Then update the existing project to utilise your new API instead of the static data.

1. Create a new component called `Card`, that will be similar to `https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#images` and use it to display the listings on the home page. It should contain an image, title and an excerpt of the description (20 characters).

1. Add some basic styling ðŸ’…

1. Add unit tests for your components.

1. Bonus: Can you make it look a bit more like <https://www.homegate.ch> ?

1. Bonus: Add another small feature of your choice from <https://www.homegate.ch>
