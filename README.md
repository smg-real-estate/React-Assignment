# Homegate React Assignment

## Start

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

## Instructions

Here is the repository for the react software engineer assignment.

This assignment consists of the following challenges:

1. Utilise the Listing component (`src/components/Listing`) and display all the listings (`/src/assets/listings.ts`) on the Home Page.

2. Allow the user to click on a listing and navigate to the specific listing details page.

Consider adding some styling.

3. Currently `any` is being used to define the type of the retrieved listing. Apply the correct type for the listing that has been found on line 7 in the `DetailsPage/index.tsx`.

4. Set up an express server to serve the listings and update the existing project to utilise your new API.

5. Create a new component called `Card`, that will be similar to `https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#images`. It should contain an image, title and an excerpt of the description (20 characters).

Consider adding some styling.
